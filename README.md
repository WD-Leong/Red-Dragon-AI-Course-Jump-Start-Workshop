# Red Dragon AI Jumpstart Workshop

This repository contains the project that I did as part of the requirements to complete the Jumpstart Workshop conducted by Red Dragon AI in March 2020. The Jupyter notebook for the project can be accessed via `Red_Dragon_Jumpstary.ipynb`, while the code can be referenced at `selfie_code.py`.
